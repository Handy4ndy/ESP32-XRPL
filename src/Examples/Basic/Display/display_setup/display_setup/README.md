# Basic Display Setup Example

This script demonstrates basic drawing techniques on an OLED display using the Adafruit SSD1306 library. It includes drawing a bitmap, characters, stylized text, and scrolling text.

 Note: This example is based on the Adafruit SSD1306 library example for SSD1306_128x64_i2c display.

## Features

- Draws a bitmap image with text.
- Draws characters of the default font.
- Draws 'stylized' characters.
- Draws scrolling text.

## Hardware Requirements

- ESP32 or compatible microcontroller with I2C capability.
- OLED display (SSD1306).

## Software Requirements

- Arduino IDE.
- ESP32 board support in Arduino IDE.
- Adafruit GFX library.
- Adafruit SSD1306 library.

## Installation

1. Open the `display_setup.ino` file in the Arduino IDE.
2. Install the required libraries:
   - Adafruit GFX
   - Adafruit SSD1306
3. Upload the code to your ESP32 or compatible microcontroller.

## Usage

1. Power on your ESP32 or compatible microcontroller.
2. The OLED display will demonstrate various drawing techniques, including:
   - Drawing a bitmap image with text.
   - Drawing characters of the default font.
   - Drawing 'stylized' characters.
   - Drawing scrolling text.

## Note

This example is based on the Adafruit SSD1306 library example for I2C 128x64 displays.
