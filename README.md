# XRPL ESP32

XRPL ESP32 is a collection of projects that use ESP32 devices to interact with the XRP Ledger (XRPL).

## Overview

This repository contains various projects that demonstrate how to use ESP32 microcontroller devices to interact with the XRP Ledger. Each project focuses on a specific aspect of XRPL functionality, such as monitoring payments to an address or detecting when a trust line is set on an issuing account.

## Projects

1. **Payment Monitor**: Monitors payments made to a specified XRP address.
2. **Trust Line Detector**: Detects when a trust line is set on an issuing account.
3. **Desktop Ledger**: Monitors real-time XRP Ledger events.
